# Term For Go
Want something that makes a command line interface just as easy as REST API's in Go? Me too.

So, how to use it?

## Routes
Similar to HTTP endpoints, you probably want multiple options on your terminal app, this is the
first parameter of the executable.

Create your routes with a specification of the arguments and supply that slice of Routes to the Router.
